The release of Baseline Protocol v0.1 represents a significant milestone, because it provides a set of standard interfaces for developers to implement solutions easily and for vendors to provide their own modules that comply with the specification. Official OASIS standards development based on the v0.1 reference implementation will commence in September. Special thanks to engineers at [Provide](https://provide.services) and [EY](https://ey.com) for an extaordinary level of contribution and to the Baseline Protocol [Maintainers](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/community-leaders) that supported the work.
